# Covid Leads for Delhi

Covid Leads Delhi is a non-profit initiative to provide reliable and trusted resources for people in need of beds, medicines, oxygen cylinders, and food services. All the leads provided on our platform are personally verified and not just scraped off of public sources. Our volunteers work on the backend of our platform to provide the best service to the people in need of these resources. All the leads for the resources are re-verified periodically by our verification team so that the people in need of the resource do not find a dead end. Our only motive is to provide a clear means of communication between the resource provider and the person in need of the resource.
